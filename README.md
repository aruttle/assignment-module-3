## Future Enhancements
With more time I would have liked to implement the following:

Replace the JSON-based booking storage with a full-featured database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) 

## User Accounts
Implement user registration and login functionality so guests can view, manage, or cancel their bookings.

## Admin Dashboard
Create an admin panel to manage accommodations, view bookings, update availability, and track analytics.

## Date Picker Calendar
Integrate a more advanced calendar UI for selecting available booking dates per accommodation.

## Email Confirmation
Automatically send a confirmation email to guests once a booking is made, with booking details and contact info.

## Modular Python structure
Move my code to a modular structure i.e from app.py to run.py with routes and models.

 

## Challenges
### During the development I came across many coding challenges, using MDN, our college notes and some AI queries I was able to solve most, some examples: 
I attempted to move my code to a modular structure i.e from app.py to run.py with routes and models but I kept getting builder errors and eventually 
I had to revert back to my original structure as I was running out of time.

Getting Flask and Render to work with my code at the start had its challenges, one issue for me was Flask would not run on port 5000. I added app.run(debug=True, port=8080) to my code to use port 8080 but it would still run on port 5000. To address this, every time I ran Flask I used the prompt "flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080" to force Flask to us port 8080. Once I done this Flask ran correctly.
