## Challenges
During the development I came across many coding challenges, using MDN, our college notes and some AI queries I was able to solve most, some examples: 
    Images used were being cropped so I found a line of css to fix this: 
![image crop](./docs/image-crop.png)

Also trying to get the quiz function to work. Initially it worked but kept returning to the first question if user answers incorrectly. Questions also repeat which was not ideal:
![quiz issue](./docs/quiz-issue.png)
I managed to get this working in the end but would have liked to add more functionality to it if I had more time.

Another issue I faced, Vscode uninstalled itself from my pc, which was worrying (as I use Vscode everyday in my day job). Its not an unknown issue:    
![quiz issue](./docs/vscode-issue.png)
I was able to reinstall it but had issues cloning the repo again, that is why there two links. 

One very strange issue I came across in Vscode was a failed to tokenize error, I could not use the comparison symbol '<=' even in the comments. I have still not fixed this issue yet even after speaking to experienced developers and web searches:
